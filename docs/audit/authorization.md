# A3 — Authorization Trace

_Phase 0 audit. Read-only._

Every route under `/api/private` is additionally gated by `middleware.ts` (proves a session exists). The table below records whether the **handler itself** independently verifies the session user owns the resource / belongs to the group **before** reading or writing.

| `/categories/[id]` | PATCH | own (non-system) | ⚠️ fetch-then-check | `findById` then `canManageCategory` | `categories/[categoryId]/route.ts:47-55` |

| `/groups/analytics` | GET | my groups | ✅ | query `members.userId` | `groups/analytics/route.ts:38` |
| `/groups/[id]` | GET | group I'm in | ⚠️ fetch-then-check | `findById` then `memberIds.includes(userId)` → 403 | `groups/[groupId]/route.ts:19-31` |

## Findings

**The anticipated "no ownership check" defect does NOT exist.** Every private route performs an independent ownership/membership check in the handler. The middleware is not relied on for authorization. This contradicts the Phase 2 framing — I am reporting it rather than inventing a fix.

Real, smaller issues that Phase 2 (S1–S5) would still improve:

1. **Fetch-then-check (⚠️), not query-scoping.** All group routes and `categories/[id]` load the full document first, then assert membership/ownership in memory. This is correct but is exactly the "fetch-then-check" pattern S3 wants replaced with query-level scoping. Group routes cannot trivially scope by membership at the DB level without changing the "Group not found" vs "Forbidden" distinction (see next point).
2. **Enumerable IDs (403 vs 404).** Group routes return **403 Forbidden** when the user is not a member (`groups/[groupId]/*`), and `categories/[id]` returns **403**, which leaks the fact that the id exists. S4 wants 404 for inaccessible resources. Personal routes already correctly return 404 (they scope by `userId` so a foreign id is simply "not found").
3. **Duplicated guard logic.** The `findById → getGroupMemberIds → includes(userId) → 403` block is copy-pasted across six group routes with no shared helper — the S1 "single access guard" target.
4. **Input validation is mostly present but uneven.** Bodies are Zod-validated everywhere. Query strings are Zod-validated on list routes. **Path params (`groupId`, `transactionId`, …) are not schema-validated** — they are passed to `toObjectId`, which throws `"Invalid identifier"` → 422 for malformed ids. Functionally safe, but not the "validate path params with Zod / reject unknown keys" of S5. Zod objects do not set `.strict()`, so unknown body keys are silently stripped, not rejected.

## S6 — secrets sanity (preview)

- No secret is read on the client; all secret access is server-side via `lib/env.ts`.
- `.env.example` contains only placeholders (`replace-with-a-long-random-secret`, empty Google creds). ✅
- **`.env` is git-ignored and untracked** (`git check-ignore .env` matches; `git ls-files` lists only `.env.example`). ✅ No credential is committed.
- `invite-code.ts` uses `Math.random()` (not crypto-strong) — not a secret, but worth noting for group invite unguessability.
