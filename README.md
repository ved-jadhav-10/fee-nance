# Fee-Nance

Most people track personal spending in one app and split group bills in another, so neither view is complete. Fee-Nance puts both in one place: personal income, expenses and budgets alongside shared group expenses and settlements, over a single account and a single set of categories.

Built with Next.js 16 (App Router), MongoDB and Mongoose. Currency is INR only.

## Status

This is coursework, actively being refactored. What exists today works end to end — auth, personal finance CRUD, group splits, balances, settlements and the analytics dashboards are all live against real data. What does not exist yet is documented honestly in [Known limitations](#known-limitations); the full remediation plan lives in `fee-nance-updates.md`, and the Phase 0 audit that produced it is in `docs/audit/`.

## Architecture

```
src/app/(app)/*          React Server Components — the authenticated shell
src/app/api/private/*    Route handlers: auth guard → Zod validation → Mongoose → JSON
src/lib/*                Pure helpers: split allocation, money rounding, access checks
src/models/*             Mongoose schemas (7 collections)
middleware.ts            Session gate over /dashboard, /finance, /groups, /analytics,
                         /profile and /api/private
```

Data flows one way: a client component calls a `/api/private` route, the handler resolves the session user, validates input with Zod, scopes the query to that user (or to a group they belong to), and returns plain JSON. Aggregation for the dashboards runs as MongoDB pipelines where possible; group balance folding currently happens in memory.

There is deliberately **no service layer yet** — business logic lives in the route handlers, with `lib/split.ts` and `lib/money.ts` as shared pure functions. Introducing one is Phase 5 of the backlog.

### Authorization model

Two independent layers:

1. **`middleware.ts`** proves a session exists for protected paths. It performs no authorization beyond that and is never relied on for ownership.
2. **Every handler re-checks access itself.** Personal resources (transactions, budgets, categories, profile) are queried with `userId` in the filter, so a foreign id simply returns 404. Group resources load the group and assert the session user is a current member before any read or write; payers and split participants are validated as members at write time.

Known gaps, tracked as Phase 2 of the backlog: group and category routes return **403** rather than 404 for inaccessible ids (which leaks their existence), membership is checked after fetching rather than in the query, the guard block is copy-pasted across six group routes, and path parameters are validated by ObjectId parsing rather than by Zod.

### Split allocation

`lib/split.ts` implements three strategies behind `computeShares`:

- **equal** — `total / n` rounded to 2 dp, with the residual pushed onto the last member so the parts sum to the total.
- **custom** — caller supplies each share; the sum must equal the total after rounding.
- **percentage** — `total × pct / 100` per member; percentages must sum to 100 and the resulting shares must sum to the total, otherwise the write is rejected.

All three compare sums with exact equality *after* rounding to 2 dp, not with an epsilon tolerance. Balances are then folded per member and reduced to a minimal set of pairwise transfers by a greedy debtor/creditor match.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI primitives, `next-themes`, `sonner`
- Recharts, plus a hand-rolled Sankey layout in the analytics suite
- NextAuth v4 (credentials + optional Google OAuth)
- MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose 9
- Zod 4

## Features

### Personal finance
- Categories: 7 seeded system categories plus user-defined ones
- Transactions: create, edit, delete, filter by date range and category
- Budgets: monthly, quarterly and yearly cycles, optionally scoped to one category
- Recurring transactions: monthly and yearly, generated on demand via `POST /api/private/transactions/recurring/run`
- Income / expense summary and running balance

### Analytics
- Financial flow Sankey (gross income → expenses / savings)
- Monthly trajectory chart, line or grouped-bar
- Expenditure composition donut with category breakdown
- Quarterly overview bars with savings annotations
- Efficiency report: savings rate, expense ratio, deduction rate, overall rating
- KPI cards: gross income, deductions, net income, expenses, net savings
- Date range presets — week, month, quarter, YTD, year, custom

### Group expenses
- Create a group (you become owner) or join one with an 8-character invite code
- Multi-payer expenses: several people can have paid toward one bill
- Equal, custom-amount and percentage splits, validated against the total
- Per-member balance computation
- Simplified pairwise settlement suggestions
- Manual settlement entries, optionally idempotent via an `idempotencyKey`

### Group analytics
- Cross-group net balance Sankey (groups you owe vs groups that owe you)
- Per-group spend timeline with stacked member bars
- Member spend share donut and net position bars
- Top expenses table
- Split type breakdown
- Settlement flow Sankey with proportional per-node flow sizing

### Auth
- Email/password registration and login (bcrypt, JWT sessions)
- Google OAuth, enabled only when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set
- Protected app shell and private API routes

## Setup and Run

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a local env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Fill the required variables in `.env`
- `MONGODB_URI`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` (usually `http://localhost:3000`)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (optional)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional)
- `LOG_LEVEL` (optional)

4. Seed demo data

```bash
npm run seed
```

5. Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open `http://localhost:3000`

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the development server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run start` — run the production build
- `npm run lint` — lint
- `npm run format` — lint with `--fix`
- `npm run seed` — seed demo data
- `npm run dbms:report` — regenerate `docs/dbms-report-output.json`

There is no test script yet; adding Vitest is Phase 4 of the backlog.

## Routes

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page |
| `/login`, `/register` | Authentication |
| `/dashboard` | Balance, trends, recent activity |
| `/finance` | Transactions, budgets, categories |
| `/groups`, `/groups/[groupId]` | Group list and group workspace |
| `/analytics` | Deeper breakdowns and trajectory |
| `/profile` | Account details and preferences |

Private APIs live under `/api/private/*`. They are enumerated in `docs/private-api-reference.md`.

## Demo Seed Data

`npm run seed` creates nine users, system categories, a year of transactions, budgets, groups, group expenses and settlements. Password is `Demo@1234` for every account:

`alex@` · `riya@` · `kabir@` · `priya@` · `arjun@` · `nisha@` · `dev@` · `sneha@` · `rahul@` — all `@feenance.demo`

## Documentation Index

Overview:
- `docs/what-is-fee-nance.md` — what the project is and who it is for
- `docs/fee-nance-features.md` — full implemented-feature list
- `docs/architecture-module-flow.md` — module and request flow

Database:
- `docs/DBMS.md` — consolidated DBMS write-up
- `docs/er-diagram.md`, `docs/relational-mapping.md`
- `docs/dbms-query-mapping.md`, `docs/mongo-relational-equivalents.md`

API and operations:
- `docs/private-api-reference.md`
- `docs/secrets-policy.md`
- `docs/demo-script.md`, `docs/manual-qa-checklist.md`

Phase 0 audit (read-only findings that drive the backlog):
- `docs/audit/codebase-map.md` — every route, model and helper
- `docs/audit/money-path.md` — where amounts are read, written and compared
- `docs/audit/authorization.md` — per-route ownership check table
- `docs/audit/split-allocation.md` — remainder handling
- `docs/audit/balance-settlement.md` — query patterns and round-trips
- `docs/audit/dead-code.md` — unused symbols and unimplemented claims

## Known limitations

Confirmed by the Phase 0 audit, not speculation:

- **Money is stored as floating-point rupees.** Correctness depends on `roundCurrency` being called after every operation, and `balances`/`analytics` still use epsilon thresholds where `split.ts` uses exact-after-round equality. Migrating to integer minor units behind a `Money` value object is Phase 1.
- **Percentage splits have no explicit remainder rule.** They reject inputs whose rounded shares miss the total instead of allocating the residual.
- **No automated tests.** The money math is unverified by anything but manual QA.
- **No service layer.** Route handlers mix validation, business logic and persistence.
- **Missing endpoints.** Group expenses and settlements cannot be edited or deleted, and there is no member-removal or leave-group route.
- **Categories hard-delete.** Transactions and budgets referencing a deleted category are left with a dangling `categoryId` and render as "Uncategorized".
- **Invite codes use `Math.random()`**, not a cryptographic source.
- **`403` on inaccessible group and category ids** allows id enumeration.

## Relational Database Design

The SQL equivalents below show how the document model maps to a normalised relational schema. Full DDL, DML and query scripts are in `sql-scripts/` — they are documentation artifacts, not runtime migrations.

### Equivalent relational schema (normalised to 3NF)

```sql
-- Core identity
Users          (user_id PK, email UNIQUE, name, password_hash, image, google_id, currency, dashboard_range, created_at, updated_at)

-- Reference data
Categories     (category_id PK, user_id FK NULLABLE, name, type, icon, color, is_system)

-- Personal finance
Transactions   (transaction_id PK, user_id FK, type, title, notes, amount, currency, category_id FK NULLABLE,
                transaction_date, recurring_enabled, recurring_frequency, recurring_next_run)
Budgets        (budget_id PK, user_id FK, name, amount, currency, cycle, category_id FK NULLABLE, period_start, period_end)

-- Group finance
Groups         (group_id PK, name, created_by FK, invite_code UNIQUE)
GroupMembers   (group_id FK, user_id FK, role, joined_at)         -- junction table
GroupExpenses  (expense_id PK, group_id FK, created_by FK, title, notes, amount, currency, split_type, incurred_at)
ExpensePaidBy  (expense_id FK, user_id FK, amount)                -- junction table
ExpenseSplits  (expense_id FK, user_id FK, share_amount, percentage NULLABLE)  -- junction table
Settlements    (settlement_id PK, group_id FK, from_user_id FK, to_user_id FK, amount, currency, note, settled_at, created_by FK)
```

### Normalisation notes

- **1NF** — All fields are atomic; repeating groups (`members`, `paidBy`, `splits`) are extracted into separate junction tables.
- **2NF** — Every non-key attribute in each table depends on the whole primary key; junction tables carry only relationship-specific attributes.
- **3NF** — No transitive dependencies; currency and user preferences are stored only on `Users`, not repeated across child tables.

### Referential integrity constraints

| Table | Foreign Key | References |
|---|---|---|
| `categories` | `user_id` | `users` (NULL = system category) |
| `transactions` | `user_id` | `users` |
| `transactions` | `category_id` | `categories` |
| `budgets` | `user_id` | `users` |
| `budgets` | `category_id` | `categories` |
| `groups` | `created_by` | `users` |
| `groupmembers` | `group_id`, `user_id` | `groups`, `users` |
| `groupexpenses` | `group_id`, `created_by` | `groups`, `users` |
| `expensepaidby` | `expense_id`, `user_id` | `groupexpenses`, `users` |
| `expensesplits` | `expense_id`, `user_id` | `groupexpenses`, `users` |
| `settlements` | `group_id`, `from_user_id`, `to_user_id`, `created_by` | `groups`, `users` |

MongoDB does not enforce these at the storage layer; they are upheld in application code, which is why the dangling-`categoryId` case listed under Known limitations is possible.

See `docs/relational-mapping.md` for the column-by-column comparison and `docs/er-diagram.md` for the ER diagram.
